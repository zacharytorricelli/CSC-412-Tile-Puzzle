# CSC-412-Tile-Puzzle
CSC 412 Intro to AI
 
 For this project, you will use search strategies to solve the 8-piece puzzle as described.
* Constraints include:
A tile cannot be removed from the environment, a tile cannot pass over or behind another tile,
a tile can only move up, down, left, or right (no diagonal moves), and a tile can only move into an empty space.

* The searches that will be implemented to solve this problem are:
1. Breadth First Search
2. Depth First Search
3. A* using the number of misplaced tiles
4. A* using the "Manhattan Distance"

(Probably should have put each search in its own .cpp and .h file)
